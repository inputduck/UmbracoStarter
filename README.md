A basic umbraco site to mess around with.

Download the repository to your hard drive.
Go to the command line/Powershell and run:

dotnet run

The site should build and provide you with a locahost address (example: localhost:14928) where you can access the site. 

To access the umbraco backoffice, add "/umbraco" to the end of the url. (example: localhost:14928/umbraco)

Note: Requires .NET 8.0

You will also need a copy of the database files. Drop me a message on Teams or Slack for them.
